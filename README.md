I am learning Rust and trying to solve AoC puzzles without LLMs.

> Code is probably shit because I am still learning.

Compile it and run specific puzzle by passing argument which includes day and the task number.
For example for day one puzzle and task two the right arg is: day1t2

### Run examples 
```
binary:
> ./day01t2

cargo: 
> cargo run --bin day01t2
```
