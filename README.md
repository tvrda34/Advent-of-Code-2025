I am learning Rust and trying to solve AoC puzzles without LLMs.

> Code is probably shit because I am still learning.

Compile it and run specific puzzle by passing argument which includes day and the task number. Arg format: day-XX-Y 

For example for day one puzzle and task two the right arg is: day1-2

### Run examples 
```
binary:
> ./compiled-binary day1-1

cargo: 
> cargo run day1-1
```
